# Project: Novocaine

## An Investor's Root Canal - A Retrospective

### Overview

Ah, Novocaine. That project. Landed on my desk on a Tuesday, as I recall. Looked like a standard dark comedy pitch â€“ "Dentist gets entangled in drugs, crime, and general mayhem." Heard that one before, right? Usually involves a mob boss or maybe a disgruntled patient with a drill fetish. Simple. Clean. Like a well-executed filling.

What we got was... well, let's just say it was less of a filling and more of an emergency extraction conducted by a squirrel hopped up on espresso.

### Investment Rationale (Initial)

   Talent: Steve Martin. Helena Bonham Carter. Laura Dern. Solid names. Steve Martin stepping into darker territory? Intriguing.
   Genre: Dark comedy/thriller. Had potential for critical buzz and a niche audience. Less crowded than your standard rom-com or action flick.
   Budget: Seemed manageable for the scope. Enough to attract the talent, not so much that one wrong move tanked the whole thing. Famous last words, I know.

### The Pitch Meeting (Or, When the Anesthetic Started Wearing Off)

The pitch was... enthusiastic. They talked about the sterile world of dentistry colliding with the grimy underbelly of crime. They promised clever dialogue, unexpected twists, and character arcs that would make you feel for the guy whose life was imploding over missing painkillers.

They didn't mention the scenes involving:

   A significant amount of illegal substances changing hands in unhygienic locations.
   Character choices that defy all known laws of logic and self-preservation.
   Situations that made our risk assessment analyst develop a nervous tic resembling Morse code for "abort, abort."

They made it sound like a Wes Anderson film set in a dental office. We should have realized it was closer to a Cronenberg film featuring excessive flossing.

> "It's about a man losing control!" they beamed.
> My internal monologue: "So is my portfolio if this goes south."

### Production Notes (Heard Through the Grapevine)

You don't visit set on every production. You get reports. Updates. Sometimes, you get cryptic phone calls.

The calls for Novocaine were... unique.

   "Uh, yeah, the scene with the [redacted]... is playing a little... edgier than scripted. Send more fake blood?"
   "Prop issue: we seem to be genuinely low on sedatives now. Is that normal?"
   "Just checking in. Was there supposed to be that much screaming during the close-up dental work?"
   "The dog? Yeah, the dog is fine. We're the ones needing therapy."

It became clear the film wasn't just about chaos; it was channeling it. Every production meeting felt like pulling teeth without novocaine â€“ painful, messy, and you weren't entirely sure what you'd pull out in the end.

### Seeing the Cut (The Grand Reveal)

Finally, the moment of truth. We sat in the screening room. The lights dimmed. The dental drilling sound design started.

It was... something.

Steve Martin, bless his heart, looked perpetually bewildered, which was perfect. Helena Bonham Carter looked like she'd just escaped from a Tim Burton fever dream, which was also perfect. The plot twisted, doubled back, tripped over itself, and occasionally did a little jig before collapsing.

There were moments where the entire investment team exchanged glances that clearly said, "Are we sure we paid for this?" Followed immediately by, "Is this... genius?"

The humor wasn't the broad, slapstick variety. It was the kind of humor that makes you uncomfortable about yourself for laughing. It was the comedy of abject failure and moral decay, set to the soothing hum of a dental drill.

### Post-Op Analysis

Did it make us Scrooge McDuck rich? No. Did it win every single award? Also no.

But it found its audience. People who appreciate the deeply weird. The cynically hilarious. The ones who understand that sometimes, the most mundane situations can unravel into absolute madness, often involving missing pharmaceuticals and questionable romantic choices.

Looking back, investing in Novocaine felt exactly like the movie itself: unpredictable, slightly painful, utterly bizarre, and ultimately, a story worth telling. It certainly cured us of ever thinking a film about a dentist would be boring. We still flinch at the sound of a high-speed drill, though. That's the true ROI.

### Status

Closed Project. Scar tissue remains.
